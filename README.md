# No Hints

This is a chrome extension to hide or show hints and questions topics on a Leetcode Question Page.
If you sometimes jump to hints very shortly after reading the question, and would like to change this habbit, consider using this extension

### Steps for Installation

1. Create a new directory (name it as you want)
2. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/Aryan03Pandey/no-hints.git ./`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable `Developer Mode` by clicking on the toggle in the top-right corner
5. Click on `Load Unpacked` near the top-left corner
6. Select the directory containing the cloned extension

The above steps should install the extension and hide any hints and question topics next time you go to any Leetcode Question.
